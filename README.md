# What Language I used
I used Python through PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
# Description
•	Made a program for people who suffer dysgraphia to help them with math to solve equations by using a deep learning model to translate from the user’s spoken words to written words and then ask the user to solve the equation orally then show him the final answer when he finishes solving the equation and if the answer doesn’t match we will show the user the steps to solve the equation.
# What I learned 
Mastering recursive functions by constructing a built-in function from the scratch using my own algorithm to solve simple linear equations using recursion
